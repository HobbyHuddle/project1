# Monochrome Project

Monochrome Game is a simple 2D puzzle platformer. The goal is for the player to restore color to the world by solving a boss challenge on each level.

Each level is laid out similar to games like Towerfall: the whole level should just about fit in 1 screen, so that no camera follow is required.

At the start of a level, the player is placed in a starting spot in a black/white monochrome world. Interacting with the environment and the objects in it can trigger color changes within the level.

To move on to the next level, the player has to unlock the final boss. Then the player must overcome the boss challenge. The challenge is story driven and may involve combat, but it can be any kind of puzzle or challenge.
